Gophish obfuscator script

Just a simple bash script based on the really-nice article by Nicholas Anastasi:
# https://www.sprocketsecurity.com/resources/never-had-a-bad-day-phishing-how-to-set-up-gophish-to-evade-security-controls

Just git download gophish and point the gophish directory to the script.

Syntax: dontphishme.sh gophish-directory
